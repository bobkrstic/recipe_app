TO RUN THIS APP:

1. git clone https://github.com/bobkrstic/recipe_app.git
2. cd into that folder
3. npm install
4. npm start

Using Edamam API to retrieve the recipes. Working with React Hooks. In order to get it working, please sign up for Emamam account here "https://www.edamam.com/". A free version will let you query the data about 10 times per minute, so be careful how many times you save the react project after changes are applied. If you get locked up, just wait a few minutes before you proceed.

For demonstration purposes, you can use the same settings without signing up for edamam database. You will be using my credentials.
